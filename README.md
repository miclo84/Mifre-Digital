This project builds my cv, portfolio and brand, and the vision is to create job opportunities. Futures employers and clients will fast get an overview of my knowledge and portfolio. 
This project starts here, but I intend to build over time with content and new features. I will be able to share my portfolio.

the menu is built with flexbox mostly, and I got some inspiration from

I wanted to make the menu responsive to the dropdown menu when media query less than 750px, but I didn't have enough time or knowledge to make it happen this time. 
I put a lot of time into the navbar.  I recognised fast that I had to move on to finish the project. I feel I could do much better with the head, logo and navbar; as I mentioned earlier, the lack of time and knowledge was on my way this time. 


Before starting the Bootcamp at Code Institute, I learned about flexbox. Many CSS programmers recommended it for its flexibility and ease of use. 
I used it although the project to position and made sections mobile responsive with few changes. In this example, you see that I used it to make the "about" section mobile responsive.

I applied my new Codeinsitute HTML and CSS course knowledge for the "contact me" section and to create form, footer, background images, and hovering.

I decided to make this project a one side project with four sections because my main goal was to focus on Semantic markup to structure HTML and get familiar with CSS. Not the content itself 

Summary 

It's My first ever HTML and CSS coding project. I had to adjust and change from my initial plan and after a chat with my mentor. Overall, I think I did ok I would like to have better knowledge, and at the same time, this gives me the motivation to learn and reach the end goal of becoming a full-stack web developer and landing jobs and different projects.

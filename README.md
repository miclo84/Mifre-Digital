Before starting the Bootcamp at Code Institute, I learned about flexbox. Many CSS programmers recommended it for its flexibility and ease of use. I used it although the project to position and made sections mobile responsive with few changes. 




In the home section, footer and background images, I used my new knowledge from Codeinsitute HTML and CSS course. 

I used flexbox frequently during the project to position and make sections mobile responsive. 

When running the project In the lighthouse for the first time, I got a score of 43% lower than expected. 

The first thing to fix is my image, set the correct height and width and make it responsive.

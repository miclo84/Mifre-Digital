In the home section, footer and backgound images I used my new gain knowledge from Codeinsitute HTML and CSS course. 

I used flexbox frequentrly during the project to positin and make secctions responsive. After some reaserch many coders recomended to use flexbox to postion and make content responsive. 

When runing project In lighthouse first time i got the score of 43% it was lower than expected. First thing to fix i my image set correct hight, width and make it responsive.
